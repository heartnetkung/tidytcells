`tidytcells` is a lightweight python package that cleans and standardizes T cell receptor (TCR) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) data to be [IMGT](https://www.imgt.org/)-compliant.
The main purpose of the package is to solve the problem of parsing and collating together non-standardized TCR datasets.
It is often difficult to compile TCR data from multiple sources because the formats/nomenclature of how each dataset encodes TCR and MHC gene names are slightly different, or even inconsistent within themselves.
`tidytcells` can ameliorate this issue by auto-correcting and auto-standardizing your data!
